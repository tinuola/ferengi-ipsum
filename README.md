# ferengi-ipsum

Does the world need another ipsum generator? If it's a Star-Trek-themed ipsum--of course it does!

For the uninitiated, an [ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/) is placeholder gibberish text used for visual mockups and to preview layouts.

For non-trekkies, Ferengi ipsum is based on the __Rules of Acquisition__, a collection of 285 "sacred" business proverbs of the [Ferengi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferengi), an alien race of ultra-capitalists. Instead of strange Latin words, you get pithy inspirational quotes that would make Gordon Gekko proud.
