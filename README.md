# Ferengi Ipsum

Does the world need another ipsum generator?<br>

If it's a *Star Trek*-themed ipsum--of course it does!

For the uninitiated, an [ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/) is placeholder gibberish text used for visual mockups and to preview layouts.

For non-trekkies, Ferengi ipsum is based on the __Rules of Acquisition__, a collection of 285 "sacred" business proverbs of the [Ferengi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferengi), an alien race of ultra-capitalists. Instead of strange Latin words, you get pithy inspirational quotes that would make Gordon Gekko proud.

## Origin Story
The idea of Ferengi Ipsum came while watching reruns of *__[Star Trek: Deep Space 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine)__*, my hands-down favorite of the  franchise. Ironically, when I watched *DS9* years ago I found Ferengis to be annoying characters. Rewatching the series a decade plus later, I cackled at their antics and scribbled down any mention of their *Rules of Acquisition*. For what purpose? I wasn't sure, but I figured it would come to me someday. And here we are... .
