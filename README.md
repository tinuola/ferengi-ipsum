# Ferengi Ipsum

Does the world need another ipsum generator? If it's a Star-Trek-themed ipsum--of course it does!

For the uninitiated, an [ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/) is placeholder gibberish text used for visual mockups and to preview layouts.

For non-trekkies, Ferengi ipsum is based on the __Rules of Acquisition__, a collection of 285 "sacred" business proverbs of the [Ferengi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferengi), an alien race of ultra-capitalists. Instead of strange Latin words, you get pithy inspirational quotes that would make Gordon Gekko proud.

## Origin Story
The idea of Ferengi Ipsum came to me while watching reruns of *Star Trek: Deep Space 9*, my hands-down favorite of the  franchises. Ironically, when I watched DS9 years ago I thought Ferengis were the most annoying characters. Rewatching the series a decade plus later, I found myself cackling at their antics and scribbling down any mention of their Rules of Acquisition. For what purpose? I wasn't sure, but I figured it would come to me someday. And here we are... .
